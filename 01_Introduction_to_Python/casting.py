# Specify a Variable Type
# There may be times when you want to specify a type on to a variable. This can be done with casting. Python is an object-orientated language, and as such it uses classes to define data types, including its primitive types.

x = int(1)   # x will be 1
y = int(2.8) # y will be 2
z = int("3") # z will be 3
